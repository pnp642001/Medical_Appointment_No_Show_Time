## Problem Statement

We know that doctors are the saviours. Whenever someone is not feeling well, they immediately want to see a doctor. For this, they need to take an appointment. Once the appointment is scheduled, it is expected that that patient will arrive on time. However, always, this is the not case. Many a times, patients skip the appointment ans thus, wasting the doctor's time and also, the slot. In this notebook, we will try to find certain reasons and insights about why and who tend to skip the appointment, also, which factors contribute in such scenario.

It appears that patients who receive scholarships have a higher likelihood of skipping their appointment.

It seems that the likelihood that the patient won't show up increases with the length of time between scheduling and appointment.

Although there isn't a direct correlation between age and whether or not the patients show up for their appointments, younger patients are more likely to do so.

Apparently, patients who received an SMS are more likely to miss their appointment, according to this bizarre data.
